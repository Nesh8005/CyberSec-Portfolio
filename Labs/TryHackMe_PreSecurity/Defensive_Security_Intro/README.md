# Defensive_Security_Intro

## Quick Win / Lab Overview
In this lab, I completed the TryHackMe **Defensive Security Intro** room. The goal was to explore defensive security (blue team) concepts and gain hands-on experience with monitoring and protecting an organization's digital assets.

**Key objectives:**
- Understand defensive security concepts.
- Learn the role of a Security Operations Centre (SOC).
- Practice digital forensics and incident response.
- Simulate using a SIEM tool to detect and respond to threats.

## Steps Completed

1. **Learned Defensive Security basics:**  
   - Defensive security focuses on preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks.  
   - Key tasks include cyber security awareness, asset management, preventative security, logging & monitoring, and policy enforcement.

2. **Explored the SOC:**  
   - Security Operations Centre (SOC) monitors networks and systems for malicious activity.  
   - Key SOC responsibilities include vulnerability awareness, detecting policy violations, unauthorized activity, and breaches.

3. **Digital Forensics:**  
   - Investigated file systems, system memory, system logs, and network logs to analyze potential threats.  
   - Used system memory analysis for detecting malware that does not write to disk.

4. **Incident Response Process:**  
   - Preparation: Creating resources, teams, and awareness programs.  
   - Detection & Analysis: Using tools and logs to identify incidents.  
   - Containment, Eradication & Recovery: Limit damage, remove threats, and restore systems.  
   - Post-Incident Activity: Review and improve processes.

5. **Practical SIEM Simulation:**  
   - Accessed a simulated SIEM system.  
   - Followed step-by-step instructions to investigate alerts.  
   - Located and recorded the **flag** for completing the exercise.

## Commands / Tools Used
- No command-line tools used for this simulation; interaction was through the web-based SIEM simulation.

## Lessons Learned
- Learned the fundamentals of **defensive security**.  
- Understood the responsibilities of **SOC analysts**.  
- Practiced **digital forensics and incident response** techniques.  
- Experienced working with a **simulated SIEM tool** to detect and respond to threats.

## Next Steps
1. Move to the next TryHackMe room: **Careers in Cyber**.  
2. Document all steps, tools, and lessons learned in the same format.  
3. Keep adding screenshots to GitHub to make the repo professional and visually clear.
