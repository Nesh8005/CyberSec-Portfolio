# 🐍 Python Practice Lab: Introduction to Writing Python Code

## 📘 Overview
This project is part of a hands-on lab designed to help beginners learn **Python programming** in a notebook environment.  
It focuses on writing simple Python code, using comments, and displaying output using the `print()` function.  
These are foundational skills for aspiring **security analysts** and anyone starting their journey in Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand how **notebook environments** work (Markdown & Code cells).
- Learn how to **write Python comments**.
- Use the **`print()` function** to display output.
- Combine multiple print statements into a single line of code.

---

## 🧠 Scenario
As a **security analyst**, you often use Python to automate tasks, analyze data, and perform security operations.  
This lab simulates your first steps in a coding notebook, where you’ll write, run, and observe simple Python code.

## 🧩 Tasks Summary

### **Task 1: Markdown Practice**
Write a simple markdown message in a text cell:
```markdown
Wassup
```
### Task 2: Display a Message
```python
# This cell displays "Hello world!"
print("Hello world!")
```
Output:

```nginx
Hello world!
```
✅ Observation: The output displays the text inside the print function.

### Task 3: Understanding Comments
```python
# In Python, comments do not get displayed
# This code cell contains only comments
```
✅ Observation: Nothing is displayed because comments are ignored by Python.

### Task 4: Writing Comments
```python
# This cell displays "I am using Python"
```
✅ Observation: No output is displayed since it’s only a comment.

### Task 5: Display a Message Using print()
```python
print("I'm a security analyst")
```
✅ Output:

```rust
I'm a security analyst
```
### Task 6: Practice Another Print Statement
```python
print("Python is useful for security!")
```
✅ Output:

```pgsql
Python is useful for security!
```
### Task 7: Combine Print Statements
```python
print("I'm a security analyst, Python is useful for security!")
```
✅ Output:

```rust
I'm a security analyst, Python is useful for security!
```
## 🧾 Observations Summary
1. Task	Observation
2. "Hello world!" printed
3. No output (only comments)
4. No output (only comments)
5.	“I'm a security analyst” printed
6.	“Python is useful for security!” printed
7.	Combined message printed

## 🏁 Conclusion
### Key Takeaways:

#### Python is simple, readable, and great for automation.

#### print() is used to display messages and debug code.

#### Writing comments (#) helps you and others understand your code.

#### Markdown cells help organize notes in notebooks.

#### Python is both useful and fun to learn!
