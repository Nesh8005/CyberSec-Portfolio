# ðŸ¥¾ Sneaker Company App â€“ PASTA Threat Model

This repository documents a threat model of a sneaker companyâ€™s new mobile application using the **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** framework.  
The goal is to identify business objectives, analyze risks, and propose security controls before launch.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage I â€“ Define Business and Security Objectives
- The app has significant back-end processing (login system, customer/seller data, sneaker listings).  
- Proper **payment handling** is critical to avoid legal issues and protect users.  
- The app must securely **process transactions** and protect user data.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage II â€“ Define the Technical Scope
**Technologies used by the application:**  
- **Application Programming Interface (API):** Enables communication between different software components.  
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** Provides encryption and digital certificates for secure communication and authentication.  
- **SHA-256:** Cryptographic hash function for securely storing and verifying data (e.g., passwords, digital signatures).  
- **SQL:** Structured Query Language for managing and querying data in relational databases.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage III â€“ Decompose Application
- Users interact with the app via login, product browsing, and messaging.  
- API facilitates data exchange between front-end and back-end services.  
- SQL database stores users, products, and transactions.  
- PKI and SHA-256 secure authentication and sensitive data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage IV â€“ Threat Analysis
- **SQL Injection** due to lack of prepared statements.  
- **Weak login credentials** leading to account compromise.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage V â€“ Vulnerability Analysis
Potential exploitable weaknesses:  
- Codebase issues (poor input validation, insecure authentication logic).  
- Database misconfigurations or unencrypted sensitive data.  
- Network flaws allowing interception of API traffic.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Stage VI â€“ Attack Modeling
**Possible attack vectors include:**  
- SQL injection â†’ Extract customer/seller/payment data.  
- Credential stuffing â†’ Compromise user accounts.  
- Man-in-the-middle attack â†’ Intercept unencrypted API traffic.  
- Exploiting code flaws â†’ Escalate privileges or bypass authentication.  

*(See: Sample Attack Tree resource)*

## ðŸ“Œ Stage VII â€“ Risk Analysis and Mitigation
**Security controls to reduce risk:**  
1. Use **prepared statements and parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.  
2. Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for account security.  
3. Conduct **regular code reviews and vulnerability scanning**.  
4. Enforce **network encryption (TLS/SSL)** for data in transit.  

---

## âœ… Key Takeaway
By applying the **PASTA framework**, the sneaker company can proactively identify risks, strengthen defenses, and ensure the app is safe to launch.
