# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio — Dineesh
## ⚡ Breaking Things Carefully • Learning Fast • Building Real Skills

Welcome to my GitHub command center. This is where I document my journey into cybersecurity with hands-on labs, scripts, writeups and future red team projects.

Everything here reflects what I’ve learned, what I’m experimenting with and what I’m building next.

## 📂 Repository Layout
### **Labs/**
Exercises from Google Cybersecurity Certificate, TryHackMe, networking practice and DNS analysis.

### **Scripts/**
Small but mighty Python and Bash tools. Starting simple and gradually evolving into automation, log parsing, and security utilities.

### **Projects/**
Larger builds including:
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate labs
- Network security exercises
- Future SOC project with Splunk detection, SIEM logs and basic threat hunting

### **QuickWins/**
Short experiments that test single concepts. Linux tasks, Packet Tracer setups and rapid-fire practice.
