##  Asset Inventory

| Asset              | Network Access | Owner                         | Location           | Notes                                                                 | Sensitivity             |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Network router** | Continuous     | Internet service provider (ISP) | On-premises        | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices connect to the 5 GHz. | Confidential            |
| **Storage devices or servers** | Occasional     | Homeowner                     | On-premises        | Contains private information, like photos.                            | Restricted              |
| **Desktop**        | Occasional     | Friend                        | On & Off-premises  | Connects to my home network.                                          | Internal-only           |
| **Game console**   | Occasional     | Homeowner                     | On-premises        | Connects to my home network.                                          | Internal-only           |

##  Key Takeaways
- The **router** is the most critical asset, requiring strict confidentiality controls.  
- **Storage devices** and **smartphones** hold sensitive personal information and must be protected with restrictions.  
- **Smart home devices** and **game consoles** don’t hold much sensitive info but can serve as entry points if compromised.  
- Asset classification ensures stronger protection is applied where it matters most.
