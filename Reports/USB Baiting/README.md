# USB Baiting Exercise ‚Äì Cybersecurity Lab

This repository documents a cybersecurity learning activity focused on **USB baiting attacks**.  
The exercise was part of a course scenario where a USB drive was discovered in a hospital parking lot.  
The goal was to assess the risks, attacker perspective, and appropriate security controls.

## üìå Scenario

While arriving at Rhetorical Hospital, a USB stick with the hospital‚Äôs logo was found on the ground.  
The device was investigated in a **virtual environment** to avoid compromising hospital systems.  

Contents observed included:  
- Personal files (family photos, pet photos, resume)  
- Work files (employee shift schedules, new hire letter)  

This mix of data highlights the dangers of storing **personally identifiable information (PII)** and sensitive work information on the same device.

## üìù Activity Responses

### 1. Contents (48 words)
The USB contains both personal and work-related files. Personal items include family and pet photos, which are considered personally identifiable information (PII). Work files include employee shift schedules and a new hire letter. Storing sensitive personal data alongside hospital documents increases the risk of exposure if the drive is compromised.  

### 2. Attacker Mindset (56 words)
An attacker could exploit Jorge‚Äôs personal data for phishing or social engineering, targeting him or his relatives. Work-related files such as employee shift schedules could help plan physical or insider attacks on the hospital. The attacker might also copy the USB, embed malicious code, and re-drop it to infect hospital systems with malware or ransomware.  

### 3. Risk Analysis (76 words)
To reduce USB baiting risks, technical controls like disabling USB autorun and enforcing endpoint protection should be applied. Operationally, employees must be trained to avoid inserting unknown devices and instead report them immediately to security staff. Managerial controls include establishing clear data handling policies and separating personal and work storage. Regular cybersecurity awareness campaigns will strengthen vigilance, while sandbox or virtual environments can be used for safe examination of suspicious USB drives.

## üîê Key Takeaways
- USB drives can contain both **malware** and sensitive data that attackers can exploit.  
- Mixing personal and professional data increases risks for both individuals and organizations.  
- Mitigation requires a combination of **technical, operational, and managerial controls**.  
- Virtual environments are the safest way to inspect suspicious media.
