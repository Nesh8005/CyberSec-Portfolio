## Detection Summary

| Metric                  | Result                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Vendors Flagged**     | 58 / 72 vendors reported as **malicious** |
| **Community Score**     | -269 (negative consensus)                 |
| **Sandbox Verdicts**    | 3 sandboxes classified as malware         |
| **Crowdsourced Result** | Confirmed malicious                       |

**Conclusion:**
 The file is **malicious** — multiple AV engines, negative community votes, and sandbox results confirm it as a threat.

## Analysis Notes

* The executable masquerades as a legitimate Windows utility (`bfsvc.exe`) but is unsigned and compiled separately using **Visual Studio 2008**.
* Sandbox reports confirm **network communication** with a known **C2 IP (104.115.151.81)** and suspicious domain names (e.g., `org.misecure.com`).
* The malware shows signs of **persistence and execution-based infection** patterns and drops executables that resemble Chrome/Google updater files.

---

## Recommendations

* Block the associated **hash**, **IP address**, and **domain name** at the firewall and endpoint layers.
* Conduct a **host-based scan** for registry entries and files linked to `bfsvc.exe` and remove infected artifacts.
* Use **Autoruns** (Microsoft Sysinternals) to find hidden persistence points and remove malicious run keys.
* Isolate affected hosts from the network and perform full forensic imaging if needed.
* Change credentials for accounts used on the infected host and monitor for suspicious authentication attempts.
* Educate employees about **malicious email attachments** and the dangers of opening password-protected files from unknown senders.
