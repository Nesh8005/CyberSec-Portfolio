# ðŸ“Š Vulnerability Assessment Report  

**Date:** 1st January 2025  
**Assessment Period:** June 2025 â€“ August 2025  
**Framework Used:** NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. System Description  
The system under assessment is a database server with the following specifications:  

- **Hardware:** High-performance CPU, 128GB RAM  
- **Operating System:** Latest version of Linux  
- **Database Management System:** MySQL  
- **Network:** Stable IPv4 connectivity  
- **Security Measures:** SSL/TLS encrypted connections  
- **Dependencies:** Interacts with other servers in the network  

This server forms the backbone of the organizationâ€™s data infrastructure and supports mission-critical operations.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Scope  
The scope of this assessment focuses on **current access controls** within the database server environment.  

- **Covered:** Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of business data.  
- **Not Covered:** Physical security, hardware replacement, or other IT infrastructure outside the defined server.  

The assessment covers a **three-month period (June â€“ August 2025)**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Purpose  
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate risks that may impact the organizationâ€™s database server.  

- The server stores **critical business data** such as customer records, financials, inventory, and transaction history. Without it, the business cannot function efficiently.  
- Unauthorized data access or modification could result in **financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences** (e.g., if customer data is leaked or sold to third parties).  
- If the server is disabled, **business continuity will be disrupted**, forcing reliance on manual processes that are slow, error-prone, and costly.

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Risk Assessment  

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk Score (L Ã— S) |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Competitor    | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1 | 3 | **3** |
| Insider / Employee | Alter or delete critical business data | 1 | 3 | **3** |
| External Attacker | Disrupt mission-critical operations (DoS/Integrity compromise) | 2 | 3 | **6** |

> **Risk Score Legend**  
> - 1â€“3: Low  
> - 4â€“6: Medium  
> - 7â€“9: High

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Approach  
This qualitative vulnerability assessment was performed using **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**.  

- Risks were evaluated based on **likelihood of occurrence** and **business impact**.  
- The selected threats represent **realistic and significant risks** to business operations, focusing on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- Emphasis was placed on threats that could **directly disrupt daily operations** or cause **long-term reputational damage**.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Remediation Strategy  

To mitigate the identified risks, the following controls are recommended:  

1. **Strong Access Controls**  
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
   - Principle of Least Privilege  

2. **Network Security**  
   - Migrate from SSL to **TLS** for secure data transmission  
   - Implement **IP allow-listing** to restrict connections to trusted networks  

3. **Data Protection & Monitoring**  
   - Continuous **auditing and logging** of database activities  
   - Automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts  
   - Encryption for data **in transit** and **at rest**  

4. **Defense in Depth**  
   - Layered security mechanisms to slow down and detect attackers  
   - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests
