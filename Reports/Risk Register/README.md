# Bank Risk Assessment Project

## Overview
This project simulates a cybersecurity risk assessment for a commercial bank using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).  
The exercise involves identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and calculating priority scores.  
The results are documented in a risk register.

## Risk Factors Summary
The bank is exposed to both cyber and physical risks due to its reliance on sensitive financial data, digital systems, and regulatory obligations.  
Cyber threats like business email compromise, database breaches, and record leaks pose significant risks to customer trust and compliance.  
Physical risks such as theft or supply chain disruptions are less likely but could still disrupt daily operations and financial stability.

## Risk Register Results

| Risk                     | Likelihood | Severity | Priority |
|--------------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Business email compromise | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Compromised user database | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| Financial records leak    | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Theft                     | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Supply chain disruption   | 1 | 2 | 2 |
