## Full Scripts

### **Presenter 1 – Introduction**

*[Slide: TOAD logo + tagline]*

> "Good morning everyone! We are excited to present **TOAD** – which stands for Teaching Offline/Online for Areas in Development.
>
> In rural communities around the world, children face serious educational barriers: **no internet**, **few textbooks**, and **understaffed schools**.
>
> TOAD solves this with an **offline-first mobile education app** that works anywhere, anytime – even without internet.
>
> Let me pass to my teammate who will introduce our users."

---

### **Presenter 2 – User Personas**

*[Slide: 4 user icons with descriptions]*

> "TOAD is designed for four main user groups:
>
> First, **students aged 6 to 14** who need fun and engaging lessons.
>
> Second, **teachers** who need tools to track their students' progress remotely.
>
> Third, **community volunteers** who want to help spread education in their villages.
>
> And fourth, **parents** who want to see their children succeed in school.
>
> Our app has seven powerful features to meet all these needs. Let me hand over to explain the first one."

---

### **Presenter 3 – Progress Tracking**

*[Slide: Dashboard screenshot with progress bars]*

> "The **Dashboard** is the heart of TOAD.
>
> When students open the app, they immediately see their **progress bars** for each subject – Math, Science, Language, and more.
>
> They also see their **total points** earned and their **study streak** – how many days in a row they've learned.
>
> **Achievement badges** celebrate milestones like 'Seven-Day Streak' or 'Math Master'.
>
> This visual feedback keeps students motivated to learn every single day."

---

### **Presenter 4 – Audio-Based Learning**

*[Slide: Audio player interface]*

> "Not all students can read fluently, and that's okay. Our **Audio Lessons** solve this problem.
>
> Students simply tap play and listen to lessons narrated in their **local language**.
>
> Files download once and play **offline forever** – no internet needed after download.
>
> The player has controls for **play/pause**, **speed adjustment**, and **skip forward**.
>
> Students can even listen while doing chores at home!"

---

### **Presenter 5 – Game-Based Learning**

*[Slide: Quiz game with points animation]*

> "Learning should be FUN, not boring! Our **Quiz Games** turn lessons into exciting challenges.
>
> Students answer **multiple-choice questions** and earn points for every correct answer.
>
> When they get it right, they see **celebration animations** – confetti, stars, and sound effects!
>
> There are **leaderboards** to compare with classmates and **daily challenges** for bonus rewards.
>
> These points directly power our next feature – avatar customization!"

---

### **Presenter 6 – Avatar Customization**

*[Slide: Avatar creator with unlockable items]*

> "Every student creates their own **TOAD Avatar** – a fun character that represents them.
>
> Using the **points they earn** from games and lessons, they can unlock new items:
>
> - Different **hairstyles**
> - Cool **outfits**
> - Fun **accessories** like hats and glasses
> - Custom **backgrounds**
>
> This reward system keeps students excited to complete more lessons. Their avatar appears on leaderboards, so friends can see their style!"

---

### **Presenter 7 – Offline Forum**

*[Slide: Forum thread list with sync indicator]*

> "Learning is better together! Our **Offline Forum** creates a supportive community.
>
> Students can browse **discussion threads** even without internet. When they write a post or reply, it's **saved locally** and syncs when they're back online.
>
> Categories include **Homework Help**, **Study Tips**, and **General Chat**.
>
> A small green or red dot shows their **online/offline status**, so they always know when their posts will upload."

---

### **Presenter 8 – Search Feature**

*[Slide: Search bar with results]*

> "With hundreds of lessons available, finding content must be **fast and easy**.
>
> Our **Search bar** appears on the home screen. Students type any keyword – like 'fractions' or 'photosynthesis' – and instantly see matching lessons.
>
> They can also search **forum posts** to find answers other students have shared.
>
> The best part? The search index is **cached locally**, so it works even **offline**.
>
> No internet? No problem!"

---

### **Presenter 9 – FM/Radio Learning Channel**

*[Slide: Radio tower broadcasting to village]*

> "What about students who don't have smartphones at all? We have a solution: **FM Radio broadcasts**.
>
> TOAD partners with **local radio stations** to broadcast lessons at scheduled times – for example, 4pm to 6pm every day.
>
> Students listen on **any radio device** – battery-powered, hand-crank, or car radio. **Zero data required**.
>
> When they access the app later, even on a shared device, their **progress syncs automatically**.
>
> This reaches the most remote students in the most challenging environments."

---

### **Presenter 10 – Technical Architecture & Closing**

*[Slide: Architecture diagram + roadmap]*

> "From a technical perspective, TOAD uses an **offline-first architecture**.
>
> Data is stored **locally** on the device using SQLite. A **background sync service** uploads progress when connectivity returns. Audio files are compressed to **only 64 kilobytes per second** to minimize storage.
>
> We're building with **React Native** to support Android devices common in rural areas.
>
> Our roadmap includes:
>
> - **Pilot launch** in 3 villages
> - **Teacher training** programs
> - Adding **video lessons** in Year 2
>
> Thank you for your attention! We welcome your **questions** and **partnership opportunities**.
>
> Together, let's bring education to every child – **online or offline**. 🐸"

## Tips for Presenters

1. **Practice timing** – Each section should be ~30 seconds
2. **Speak clearly** – Especially technical terms
3. **Point to slides** – Reference visuals when explaining features
4. **Smooth handoffs** – End with "Let me hand over to..." or "Next, my teammate will explain..."
5. **Eye contact** – Look at the audience, not just the screen
6. **Energy** – Show enthusiasm for the project!

## Q&A Preparation

Be ready to answer:

1. "How do you handle content in multiple languages?"
2. "What's the cost per student?"
3. "How do you ensure content quality?"
4. "What happens when two devices sync the same account?"
5. "How do you partner with radio stations?"
